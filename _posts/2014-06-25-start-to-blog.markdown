There's always a start for everything right? And why not me blogging...
You may wonder why now, and what I have done until now? Actually there are several reasons.

### Posting

I just want to post my thoughts and discoveries on various subjects: coding, life, fatherhood, etc. Anything!
This is the just the starting point.

### Keeping track

This is the most personal reason. As a coder, I want to remember every languages, frameworks, trends, I found, tried, tested.

### Sharing

In the world, we live, everyone can be informed in real time. Social medias push this to the extreme,
as the content presented here will be (in)directly seen to any followers, or followers of followers.
The world is global and public.

### Opening discussion

It does not end with posting and sharing. The content proposed is not to be taken as it stands.
It surely will open a discussion for criticism, broaden the subject.



*Enough for now. For later on, I will try to post as much as possible!!!*
