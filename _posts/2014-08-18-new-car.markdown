It's done. We have got our new car : a *Renault Scenic 1.9 DCI 130 CV*, since a few weeks. 
That is a big change after the previous *Renault Clio second generation*, where there was really nothing included.

The most basic thing that I and my familly enjoyed right away is the **air conditionning**. This is a relief. At last, we are not suffocating in the car!

There are additionnal tools like *rearview cameras* that ease to park the car, which is ultra cool. Actually, what is really keeping my attention right now is the *fuel live-tracking*. 

Usually, it should be 6L/100 when driving in the city. And guess what ? I started at 8.6L/100. What? Yes, my driving is way too aggressive. Thus, this is my new video game. I constantly watching the tracking to improve my driving, reduce fuel consumption and earn more distance for free (or it seems). At the moment: 7.4L/100. Not bad, but can do better.

We'll see during the Portugal vacations (and the **20 hours of car**!!!), how it goes on the highways.
