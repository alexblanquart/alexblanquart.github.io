A quick post to annunciate my new blog with a better look and feel than the raw and old one. 

Thanks to [Hyde](https://github.com/poole/hyde), this was quite easy as cloning the repository and make changes directly on files like:

* _config.yml : setting global variables
* sidebar.html : removing some things I do not really want to use for now
* about.md, markdown posts : adding my personal stuff

I have to say. [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) coupled to [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) makes the construction of a blog/static website very accessible and straightforward. 

On the other hand, installing ruby, jekyll and all the other stuff, as suggested by github, could be hard. As such, I will stay for now with the automatic building of the pages. I only need to add one markdown file like this one and I am done! Easy right ?!
